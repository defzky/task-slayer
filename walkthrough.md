### 2. Inventory Management 🎒
Go to the **Goblin Shop** tab to access your **Backpack**.

### 3. Usage Effects
- **Using a Potion**: Triggers a "Focus Mode" toast and opens a Lo-Fi beats playlist.
- **Using a Scroll**: Currently shows an instruction alert (Feature to be expanded).

### 4. Quest Tabs 🗂️
The quest board is now organized into three tabs:
- **Active**: Current quests that are not expired.
- **Completed**: History of your victories.
- **Failed**: Quests that missed their deadline. (They look scary!)

2. Complete them rapidly to trigger a drop (look for the "ITEM DROP!" toast).
3. Go to the **Shop -> Backpack** tab.
4. Try clicking "Use" on an item.
